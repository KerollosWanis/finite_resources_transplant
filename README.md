# Abstract

Investigators often evaluate treatment effects by considering settings in which all subjects are assigned a treatment of interest, assuming that an unlimited number of treatment units are available. However, many real-life treatments may be constrained and cannot be provided to all subjects in the population. For example, patients on the liver transplant waiting list cannot be assigned a liver transplant immediately at the time they reach highest priority because a suitable organ is not likely to be immediately available. In these cases, investigators may still be interested in the effects of treatment strategies in which a finite number of organs are available at a given time, that is, treatment regimes that satisfy resource constraints. Here, we describe an approach to emulate target trials of treatment strategies that satisfy resource constraints using observational data, and we apply this approach to estimate the effect of restricting or expanding utilization of ‘increased risk’ liver organs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease. Our target trials are designed to evaluate plausible and policy-relevant interventions in the setting of finite treatment resources.

- `main.R` — R file which contains further details describing the analysis, and which allows users to reproduce the main analyses by running the code contained in `scripts`.
- `scripts`  — Scripts to reproduce the main analyses in the manuscript.
- `data`  — Raw data should be inserted in this folder. Data are available from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients by application
